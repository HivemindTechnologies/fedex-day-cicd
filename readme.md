Cannot find a way to combine ZIO with Spark.

For testing code, there is one file named clientTest in tests Pls Build the whole project and run that.

the requestString contains the request json as string. 

the result will be printed when it is running and also will write the result to a json file in main/scala/resources/outputs. But the file in it need to be deleted before running the test.
